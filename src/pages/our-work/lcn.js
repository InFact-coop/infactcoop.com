            Law Centres Network (or LCN) are the central body of nationwide
            pro-bono law centres. A vital part of their work is campaigning for
            policy changes to laws which disadvantage society's most vulnerable.
            LCN collects statistics so that they can understand the shifting
            portrait of their visitors, and present that narrative to
            parliament. However, at the beginning of our involvement, each law
            centre was providing data in many different formats, making them
            hard to combine and make sense of.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge was to provide a platform allowing Law Centres to
            quickly share statistics with LCN. The platform also had to allow
            law centre staff to connect with eachother, and share feedback with
            head office.

          LCN were a part of CAST's Digital Fellowship programme. After a design
          sprint and subsequent user testing, we decided to run a follow-up
          workshop. We clarified the problem space, and through a series of
          exercises designed to challenge our preconceptions, we visualised
          intuitive new ways to organise the platform.

          We created the LCN Feedback Platform, which:
          <ul className="tl">
            <li>
              Allows Law Centre workers to input statistics (for instance how
              many people they have given advice for that week) so that LCN can
              collect consistent data from across the network
            </li>
            <li>
              Allows users to quickly and easily share their case studies,
              success stories, trends, or annoyances with both LCN and their
              peers around the country
            </li>
            <li>
              Stores both statistics and comments in a way that is easily
              accessible to LCN, to notice trends across the country
            </li>
            <li>
              Implements a robust login feature with different permissions for
              administrators or regular users

              Working in collaboration with young people, parents and
              clinicians, we designed and built an app that helps young people
              with ADHD to manage their symptoms.
