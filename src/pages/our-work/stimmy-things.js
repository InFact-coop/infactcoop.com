        <WorkDescription>
          We were approached by Slam, a leading mental health trust, and the
          Anna Freud Centre, a young person's mental health charity. They asked
          us to work together with young people with ADHD to identify ways in
          which some of their symptoms could be alleviated through the use of
          technology.

        <WorkDescription>
          One young person taught us about 'Stims' - self-soothing exercises
          performed by people with a number of disorders helping them to relax,
          focus their minds and concentrate in the face of overwhelming sensory
          input. Her idea of a "virtual self-soothe box" was so complete and
          compelling that we decided to bring it to reality for our app.

          We built an app which:

            <li>
              Engages our audience with fun and friendly design and animations
            </li>
            <li>
              Enables users to save their own personalised stims so they can
              easily use them in the future
            </li>
            <li>
              Allows our users to connect with other people facing similar
              struggles via a stim-sharing platform
            </li>
            <li>
              Gives near-complete access to the app offline and from the home
              screens through the use of Progressive Web App technology
