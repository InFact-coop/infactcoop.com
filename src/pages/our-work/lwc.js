          Lancashire Womenâ€™s Centers is a one stop shop offering safe,
          non-judgemental and professional support to women. LWC face a plethora
          of challenges including:
          <ul className="tl">
            <li>
              the complex emotions of stigma and fear of judgement attached to
              seeking help with services.
            </li>
            <li>
              struggling with using the LWC peer support group to its fullest
              extent.
            </li>
            <li>
              the need to make sure that users are getting the services that are
              right for them.

        <WorkDescription>
          Running a design workshop with LWC we discovered a common theme
          running through their challenges and decided to focus on improving the
          way that women access the services on offer. This included thinking a
          lot about how to make the design sensitive, warm and easy to use.
